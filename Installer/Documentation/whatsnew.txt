Welcome to FreeArc 0.51 (April 24 2009)

Main changes in this version:

    * Significant improvements in GUI and lots of fixed problems, result in that now GUI version is more stable, feature-rich and may be used for daily work
    * -m2/-m3/-m4 modes now use 96mb dictionary by default. Speed/compresion ratio was also improved in many other ways
    * Fixed three (de)compression bugs - while these are not critical, I recommend you to upgrade

Also
    * GUI: Skin changer provides more themes; default theme was also improved
    * GUI: You can change menu/toolbar (just copy freearc.menu.example to freearc.menu and edit it as you wish)

    * GUI: Single-click on the empty space at the right clears selection, double-click selects all files
    * GUI: If you move/resize any window, dialog or filemanager column - its size and position are preserved
